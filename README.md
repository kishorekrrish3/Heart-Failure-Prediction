## Overview

This project focuses on predicting heart failure using machine learning techniques. We have implemented various classifiers such as SVM, KNN, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting to predict the occurrence of heart failure.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Installation

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

Classifiers Used
SVM (Support Vector Machine) Classifier
KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) Classifier
Stochastic Gradient Descent
Gaussian Naive Bayes
Decision Tree Classifier
Gradient Boosting

Results
Among the classifiers, the SVM Classifier achieved the highest accuracy score of 89%.
